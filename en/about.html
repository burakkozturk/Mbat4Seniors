        <p class="first-p">Researchers have long shown that art therapy has a particularly positive effect on adult
            mental health. In
            most of European countries for many years mental health system has been underfunded, short-staffed,
            over-medicalised, and mostly based on psychiatric hospitals. Persons with mental disorders experienced
            bullying and they were avoided in society.</p>

                The dominant way of thinking about people with mental disorders was as a threat that is to be isolated. The modern approach to the treatment of mental disorders through a variety of therapies is relatively new, especially in post-Soviet countries.

                Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy (MBAT, author dr. Laury Rappaport) is the combination of art therapy and mindfulness and a relatively new concept that aims to include the creative process of art-making in self-exploration. The approach combines the idea of mindfulness through creative activities, where one immerses himself in the process of creating artistic expressions and thereby mindfully exploring oneself.  Our project has no intention to copy Laury Rappaport's original MBAT version, however we've adapted this  approach, in order to meet the European conditions.
